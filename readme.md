# Vizer: a simple trame-based viewer

A simple viewer for raw image files and other datasets supported by ParaView.
For raw image datasets where filenames are named in a specific form, this creates
a quad view showing slices and volume visualization. For all other datasets, this
creates a simple surface viewer.
